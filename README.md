# Train Detection and Warning System COP315

To warn construction workers working on train tracks about approaching trains through a hooter

 • To detect the train 2 to 3 KMs away
 
 • To detect the direction of the incoming train
 
 • To communicate and trigger a hooter, at the site of Work
 
 Constraints: This needs to be done without any device or sensing on the tracks or on the locomotives



The project can be divided into three broad categories namely:

• Primary Sensor: Audio Recording and Signal Processing

• Secondary Sensing: Ultrasound Sensing and direction detection

• Communication: from sensor to Work Site through Radio Waves
