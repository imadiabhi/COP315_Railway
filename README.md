# Train Detection and Warning System COP315

### Audio detection:

    audio_detect.py
   
This code records sound for six seconds and computes crosscorrelation coefficient with sample recording 't37.wav'.
'correlation coefficient values of various audio samples.xls' file contains the analysed data from which cut-off '0.65' is being decided.
if correlation coefficient is grater than 0.65, it means that the train was present at the time of recording.
