# Train Detection and Warning System COP315

To warn construction workers working on train tracks about approaching trains through a hooter

 • To detect the train 2 to 3 KMs away
 
 • To detect the direction of the incoming train
 
 • To communicate and trigger a hooter, at the site of Work
 
 Constraints: This needs to be done without any device or sensing on the tracks or on the locomotives

Motivation:

● Need of a Safety Device/ Warning System for workers working on Railway Tracks.The
existing system involves a person standing around 3 km away from the site to inform the
workers of approaching train, leading to risking the life of workers to human error.

● There are 30,348 level crossings of which around 40% (11563) are unmanned. As per
statistics taken from TOI, 723 people had been killed from 2010 to 2014 due to the lack of a
Warning system.

● Moreover, when some work is going on on a track, then this also leads the given and
adjacent tracks vulnerable to derailment of trains, due to negligence of workers, and by
fault blocking the rails, not getting enough time clear the track.

● Our project aims to target all the above issues starting from our main problem statement of
Warning system for train workers. Our future aspects during the course of project involve
expansion of the devised technology in application at unmanned crossings.

Our Proposal

Thus, the project can be divided into three broad categories namely:

• Primary Sensor: Audio Recording and Signal Processing

• Secondary Sensing: Ultrasound/Laser/Thermal/Image Sensing

• Communication: from sensor to Work Site through Radio Waves
